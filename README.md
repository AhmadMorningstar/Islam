# Data Deletion Policy â€“ Islam app

**Developer:** Ahmad Morningstar  
**App Name:** Islam

## Data Collection
This app only accesses your **device location** (GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile network) to calculate the direction of the Qibla.  
No data is collected, shared, or stored on any remote servers.

## Data Deletion
The Qibla Finder app **does not store any personal data**.  
All data used (like your current location and compass direction) exists only temporarily in your deviceâ€™s memory.  

Once the app is **closed or uninstalled**, all related data is permanently deleted automatically.

## Request Data Deletion
Since no data is stored, there is nothing to delete.  
However, if you have any questions or want to confirm, you can contact me via email:
